# SEC Filings Analytics Program Roadmap

## 1. Define Scope & Success Metrics
- Capture target report structures, required SEC form coverage (e.g., 10-K, 8-K), screening filters, delivery cadence, and measurable KPIs (latency, data freshness, accuracy thresholds).

## 2. Data Source Strategy
- Confirm ingestion approach (EDGAR API, bulk feeds, third-party providers), access policies, throttling rules, retention requirements, and separate plans for historical backfill vs. incremental updates.

## 3. Solution Architecture
- Draft diagrams covering storage layers (raw documents, metadata, analytics outputs), processing tiers, service/API boundaries, auth strategy, and integration points with the existing NestJS backend.

## 4. Infrastructure Blueprint
- Select environments (dev/test/prod), hosting platform, secrets management, observability tooling, and CI/CD expectations before coding begins.

## 5. Document Ingestion Pipeline
- Design fetchers, format conversion (PDF/HTML/XBRL â†’ normalized text), metadata extraction, retry/error handling, and persistence for both raw and processed artifacts.

## 6. Screening Database & Indexing
- Model entities for companies, filings, sections, and financial metrics; determine databases for structured metadata versus full-text search/embeddings; plan schema migrations and seed data.

## 7. AI Analysis Layer
- Outline NLP/LLM workflows (chunking, embeddings, prompt templates), model selection (hosted vs. external API), guardrails, caching, and evaluation metrics for accuracy, bias, and hallucination rates.

## 8. Report Generation Engine
- Map required report templates, scoring systems, narrative sections, and output formats (JSON, PDF, dashboards); specify how user inputs influence analysis focus and report customization.

## 9. Orchestration & Scheduling
- Define job lifecycles (full refresh, delta ingest, re-analysis), batching or queueing requirements, scheduling cadence, and manual override procedures for urgent filings.

## 10. API & Integration Plan
- Enumerate endpoints for triggering scans, retrieving reports, and managing configuration; establish authentication/authorization and data contracts for downstream consumers.

## 11. Testing & Verification
- Prepare representative datasets for unit/integration tests; design evaluation harnesses for AI outputs; schedule user acceptance checkpoints with annotated SEC document samples.

## 12. Documentation & Handoff
- Plan creation of runbooks, architectural documentation, data dictionaries, and user guides; define feedback loops and change management processes post-launch.

## 13. Implementation Cadence
- After roadmap approval, iterate feature-by-feature: prototype ingestion, validate, then layer analysis and reporting, keeping code changes scoped per milestone with continuous reviews.
